Messing around with data relating to housing prices in Canberra.
Complete code [here](https://github.com/mngu2382/CanHouse).

This started when some friends, in the process of making some large
decisions, asked me to see if I could get some stats on the changes in
house prices in northern Canberra in the last 5-10 years.

Of course I could have looked at the
[ABS house price index for Canberra](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6416.0),
for more local statistics I could have also looked at the summaries
provided on
[domain.com.au](http://apm.domain.com.au/Research/?AddressLine=2601&LocationType=Postcode&State=ACT&PostcodeId=131).
But the summaries from both source do leave a bit to be desired.
Luckily the records of property sales on domain.com.au can be
relatively easily accessed, giving me the opportunity to have a spot of
fun.
